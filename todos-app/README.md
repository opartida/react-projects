## Requirements

* node 16
* yarn

Make sure that after running `yarn install` command `db.json` file was created in the root directory. If it wasn't created just run `yarn prepare` or manually copy `db.json.sample` and name it as `db.json`. 

## Available Scripts

To run the TODO app run:

### `yarn start`

To run the mocker API part run:

### `yarn start:server`

To run tests run:

### `yarn test`

## Tasks

1. Analyze the code. Apply any improvements like refactoring, restructuring, bad practices fixes, etc. if necessary.
2. Add missing types to the places where they are needed.
3. Add some basic styling. Not too fancy and not too complex. CSS, SCSS, or styled-components can be used.
4. Make all new `todos` preserve on the API side - when the page is reloaded or the whole app is restarded all added todos should be preserved. You might need to check [json server docs](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
5. Add todo toggle functionality - via clicking a todo should change its status of `done`. All the changes should be preserved on the API side.
6. Submit a `pull request` when you are ready. :)
